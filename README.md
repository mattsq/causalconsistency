# Causal Consistency NN

This repository provides an implementation of the causal-consistency neural network described in `Prompt.txt`.

## Quick start

```bash
poetry install
poetry run python src/train.py
```

The model enforces the factorisation $X \to Y \to Z$ by sharing a backbone encoder and three output heads. See the documentation in `docs/` for details.

## Running tests

Use `pytest` together with `pytest-cov` to measure coverage locally. Coverage must remain above 90â€¯%:

```bash
pip install -e . pytest pytest-cov
pytest --cov=src --cov=tests --cov-report=term --cov-fail-under=90
```
